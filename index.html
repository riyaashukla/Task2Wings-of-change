    <h1>Wings of Change — Empowering Women, Transforming Futures</h1>
    <p>From silence to strength, from shadows to spotlight — Project Udaan is rewriting the story of women’s empowerment in India.</p>

    <h2>Breaking the Chains of Limitation</h2>
    <p>For too long, countless women have been denied the chance to soar because of invisible chains — poverty, tradition, and lack of opportunity. Project Udaan doesn’t just break these chains; it replaces them with wings. Through awareness drives, family dialogues, and confidence-building sessions, Udaan transforms how communities see women: not as dependents, but as decision-makers.</p>

    <h2>Empowerment Beyond Employment</h2>
    <p>True empowerment isn’t just a paycheck; it’s the ability to dream, decide, and lead. Udaan offers skill-building programs in tailoring, handicrafts, technology, and business management, paired with financial literacy and leadership training. These are not just lessons — they are keys to independence and self-worth.</p>

    <div class="quote">“When you empower a woman, you empower a community. When you give her wings, she changes the direction of the wind.”</div>

    <h2>Stories That Ignite Hope</h2>
    <p>Meera was once told her place was in the kitchen. Today, she runs a thriving boutique and mentors other women entrepreneurs. Rukhsana, widowed and struggling, learned digital skills through Udaan and now earns a steady income from a remote job — while teaching others to do the same. These women are living proof that opportunity is the spark; courage is the flame.</p>

    <h2>A Ripple That Transforms Communities</h2>
    <p>An empowered woman educates her children, uplifts her family, and inspires her neighbors. Udaan’s work multiplies impact — each success story lights the path for many more. This is not just change; it’s a revolution in progress.</p>

    <h2>A Call to Action</h2>
    <p>The sky is wide, but not every woman has been given her wings. It’s time we change that. Support Project Udaan — mentor, donate, or share these stories. Together, we can ensure every woman not only dreams but also dares to fly.</p>
