    <h2>From Shadows to Spotlight: Women Leading with Confidence</h2>

    <p>Across India, countless women still navigate life in the shadows—restricted by tradition, denied opportunities, and silenced by societal norms. <strong>Project Udaan by InAmigos Foundation</strong> is changing that narrative. It’s more than a program; it’s a movement designed to ignite courage, unlock potential, and elevate women into leadership roles where they can shape their own futures.</p>
    <h3>Breaking Barriers with Purpose</h3>
    <p>Udaan provides safe platforms for women to speak, learn, and lead. Through targeted leadership workshops, mentorship programs, and community dialogues, women gain not just skills but also the confidence to challenge stereotypes and claim their place in decision-making spaces.</p>
    <h3>Empowering through Skills</h3>
    <p>From digital literacy to entrepreneurship training, Udaan equips women with tools that lead to economic independence. Many participants have launched small businesses, driven local development projects, and become advocates for gender equality in their regions.</p>
    <h3>Multiplying the Impact</h3>
    <p>An empowered woman doesn’t just change her life; she transforms her community. Udaan fosters networks where women support, mentor, and uplift each other—turning isolated voices into a collective force for change.</p>
    <h3>The Vision Ahead</h3>
    <p>With plans to expand into more underserved areas, Udaan aims to build a generation of resilient, visionary women leaders. Every voice matters, and every dream deserves a chance to soar.</p>
